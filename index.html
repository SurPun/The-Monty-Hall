        <h2>How To Play?</h2>
        <p>
          I have hidden a car behind one of these three doors.<br />
          Behind the other two doors there are goats.<br />
          If you choose the door with the car, you win the car! <br />
          If you choose a door with a goat, you get a goat.<br />
          Click on a door to choose it.<br />
          I will display one goat and allow you to stay with your choice or
          switch doors.<br />
          Choose your options and click keep or switch button.<br />
          I will then reveal the location of the car. <br />
          Click on play again button to restart. <br />
          <em>Should you stay with your first choice, or switch?</em>

          <p>
            The Monty Hall problem has confused people for decades. In the game
            show, Lets Make a Deal, Monty Hall asks you to guess which closed
            door a prize is behind. The answer is so puzzling that people often
            refuse to accept it!

        <h3>What is the Monty Hall Problem?</h3>

        <div class="the-problem grid-container width-50">
          <img src="./images/mh-doors.png" alt="3 doors" class="responsive" />
          <ul>
            <li>Monty Hall asks you to choose one of three doors.</li>

            <li>
              One of the doors hides a prize and the other two doors have no
              prize.
            </li>

            <li>
              You state out loud which door you pick, but you dont open it
              rightaway.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="the-problem grid-container width-50">
          <img
            src="./images/mh-doors2.png"
            alt="door with a goat"
            class="responsive"
          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Monty opens one of the other two doors, and there is no prize
              behind it.
            </li>

            <li>
              At this moment, there are two closed doors, one of which you
              picked.
            </li>

            <li>
              The prize is behind one of the closed doors, but you dont know
              which one.
            </li>
            <li>Monty asks you, “Do you want to switch doors?”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            The majority of people assume that both doors are equally like to
            have the prize. It appears like the door you chose has a 50/50
            chance. Because there is no perceived reason to change, most stick
            with their initial choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            It turns out that there are only nine different combinations of
            choices and outcomes. Therefore, I can just show them all to you and
            we calculate the percentage for each outcome.

            Heres how you read the table of outcomes for the Monty Hall problem.
            Each row shows a different combination of initial door choice, where
            the prize is located, and the outcomes for when you “Dont Switch”
            and “Switch.” Keep in mind that if your initial choice is incorrect,
            Monty will open the remaining door that does not have the prize.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first row shows the scenario where you pick door 1 initially and
            the prize is behind door 1. Because neither closed door has the
            prize, Monty is free to open either and the result is the same. For
            this scenario, if you switch you lose; or, if you stick with your
            original choice, you win.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the second row, you pick door 1 and the prize is behind door 2.
            Monty can only open door 3 because otherwise he reveals the prize
            behind door 2. If you switch from door 1 to door 2, you win. If you
            stay with door 1, you lose. The table shows all of the potential
            situations. We just need to count up the number of wins for each
            door strategy. The final row shows the total wins and it confirms
            that you win twice as often when you take up Monty on his offer to
            switch doors.
