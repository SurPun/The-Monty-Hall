# Monty Hall Problem - Take Home Challenge (2022-11-17 - 2022-11-24)

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.

Statistically the best option is to switch doors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Gain an understanding of the problem - perhaps see how your friends react if you play the part of the host.
- [x] Convince yourself that Vos Savant was correct.
- [ ] Design and write software that will run sample games employing either the stick or switch strategy.
- [ ] Put the code in a public GitHub repository
- [ ] Use your software to show that switching doors is statistically the best option.
- [ ] The elegance of the output is not important so long as the program can be used to prove the point.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:

- [ ] See instructions
- [ ] Switch between game mode and simulation mode
- [x] Select a door
- [ ] Keep or switch my choice
- [ ] Run simulation for n number of times for keep/switch choice selection
- [ ] See the proof that switching doors is statistically the best option
